- Assignment was completed individually in T2 2020 for COMP1521: Computer System Fundamentals.
- Task was to implement a provided cellular automation renderer written in C, and rewrite it in MIPS assembly code.
- This project had a focus on gaining experience writing MIPS assembly code, and using data and control stuctures in MIPS.
- Project Spec can be found in spec.md.
- Application is very difficult to run outside of a unsw cse machine (as it is run using the provided command: ```1521 spim -f cellular.s```)
- A final mark of 97/100 was awarded and was worth 15% of grade.
